(At no cost, ie with the same data)

- This creates a new Note Type:
- `Add->Type->Manage->Add->Clone: Basic (type in the answer)`
- Then do
- `Cards...->Options (next to Card Type drop-down list)->Add Card Type->`

- And for each (to configure each one select it in the drop-down list), set Back and Front from the respective folders. 
- And the common styling of course.
